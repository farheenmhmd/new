 <p>Daisy is a tall orange/yellow/green daisy. Free-spirited and energetic, Daisy participates in sports and other activities. She is a close friend of both Oswald and Henry; the three of them often go on adventures together. Daisy loves sunflower sundaes, riding her unicycle, has a large leaf collection and loves peppermint tea. Daisy is very excitable and often has to be hushed by Oswald when she speaks too loudly.<br><i>Let us have a look at Daisy</i><br><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/oswald/images/b/b1/Oswald_Daisy_7.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/150/height/150?cb=20150923180854" alt="Pic of Daisy" width="75" height="100"</p>
