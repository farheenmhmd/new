 <p>Henry, the Penguin is Oswald's downstairs neighbor and best friend. He does his best to maintain a rigid schedule, which includes taking care of his extensive spoon collection, ending every evening watching "Penguin Patrol", his favorite TV show, and doing the Penguin Polka before bedtime. Most of Henry's favorite foods are fish-flavored and he is a proven expert on snow. He has an identical cousin from the North named Louie. His motto is "slow and steady".<br><i>Let us have a look at Henry</i><br><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/oswald/images/b/b1/Oswald_Daisy_7.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/150/height/150?cb=20150923180854" alt="Pic of Daisy" width="300" height="300"</p>
